    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Baking Powder</li>
      <li>Butter or Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking
        powder, sugar, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine Wet Ingredients: In a separate bowl or measuring jug, whisk
        together the milk, egg, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla extract.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine Wet and Dry: Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture. Stir
        gently with a whisk or spatula just until combined.
        <br />
        <em
          >Tip: Do not overmix. Small lumps are fine, and overmixing leads to
          tough, rubbery pancakes.</em
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Rest the Batter: Let the batter rest for 10–15 minutes. This allows the
        flour to fully hydrate and the baking powder to activate, resulting in a
        fluffier texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the Batter: Pour approximately 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet
        for each pancake. Do not overcrowd the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until Bubbles Form: Cook for 2-3 minutes. Look for bubbles to form
        and pop on the surface, and for the edges to look dry and set.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve: Remove from the pan and serve immediately with butter, maple
        syrup, or fruit.
      </li>
    </ol>

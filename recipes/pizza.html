    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Yeast</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the Dough: Combine flour, yeast, salt, water, and olive oil.
        Knead for 10-15 minutes until smooth and elastic, then let it rise in a
        warm place until doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the Oven and Stone: Preheat your oven to a high temperature,
        ideally 450°F to 500°F (230-260°C). Place a pizza stone or heavy baking
        sheet inside to get hot for 30-60 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare Sauce and Toppings: Make a simple, thick sauce using tomatoes,
        olive oil, garlic, and herbs. Shred mozzarella cheese and prepare
        desired toppings (meats, vegetables).
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the Dough: Punch down the risen dough and divide it. On a floured
        surface, stretch or roll out the dough to about 1/4-inch thickness,
        leaving the edges slightly thicker for a crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the Pizza: Place the dough on a pizza peel or parchment paper.
        Spread a thin layer of sauce, top with cheese, and add toppings
        sparingly to ensure a crisp crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the Pizza: Transfer the pizza to the preheated stone or baking
        sheet in the oven. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden
        brown and the cheese is bubbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve: Remove from the oven, let it rest for a few minutes, slice, and
        serve.
      </li>
